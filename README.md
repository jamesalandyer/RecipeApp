# Steps to Run the App
1. Open the project file in Xcode
2. Run the app

# Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I prioritized the UI aspect of the project as it seemed to be the more complicated part of it. With it being a simple API call, it didn't take much to set it up.

# Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
It took several hours. Most of it was spent on getting the UI right then testing to make sure the app covered everything it needed to cover.

# Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I had to make a decision not to set up a design system to make sure the all padding and settings were consistent throughout the app. It was unnecessary on an app this size.

# Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
UI and the loading experience. I could spend more time to make placeholders for the cards and better animate the changing of states.

# External Code and Dependencies: Did you use any external code, libraries, or dependencies?
I used a library for the image cache. I chose it because used SwiftUI's AsyncImage under the hood.

# Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
There are a lot of things that iOS 17 adds to help make better and more fine tuned UIs. I made it minimum iOS 16 because of your app being that, but could have made some improvements with iOS 17.
